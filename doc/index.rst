   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to q3py's documentation!
================================

``q3py`` is a `Quake 3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena>`_ to `Python <https://www.python.org/about/>`_ bridge.

.. warning::
    This is a work in progress and not meant for public use (yet)!

Quake 3 uses separate modules for its game logic, i.e. client,
server and user interface.
Those modules can be loaded either in QVM (a ``.qvm`` file) or
shared native library (a ``.dll``, ``.so`` or ``.dylib`` file) format.

Now ``q3py`` is a shared library which implements the API that Quake 3
expects, but it relays all calls to a Python module.
To do so, q3py embedds ``libpython3`` and provides a Python extension
module to allow the Python code to call back into Quake 3.

.. todo::
    The SVG/PNG generated by Sphinx has a random name and thus can not
    be linked to from the GitHub README.rst

What q3py allows you to do is write Quake 3 game logic, also known
as "mods", with Python.
However, you need to provide all of the logic. To add e.g. homing missiles
to the BFG, you would need to implement players, items, pyhsics and
weapons in Python as well, you can not extend upon the C code  of an
existing Quake 3 game module.
