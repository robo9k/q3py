Welcome to q3py's documentation!
================================

``q3py`` is a `Quake 3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena>`_
to `Python <https://www.python.org/about/>`_ bridge.

.. warning::
    This is a work in progress and not meant for public use (yet)!

The first-person shooter "Quake 3" uses separate modules for its game
logic, i.e. client, server and user interface.

``q3py`` is such a Quake 3 module, but it relays all calls to a Python
module.
To do so, q3py embedds ``libpython3`` and provides a Python extension
module to allow the Python code to call back into Quake 3.
